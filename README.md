# seventypercentage

Seventy Percentage is a website made for NASA Space Apps Hackathon. Our challenge was called 'Ocean Gardens'.
The purpose of our project was to educate the importance services provided by Oceans in our lives through 
pictures or videos in an interactive way.Made by a 6 members team in the 48hrs hackathon.
I worked on the page climate.html and its corresponding CSS. The page has a quiz made with JacaScript.
